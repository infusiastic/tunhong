# Tunhong parser

A library for Ruby 2.0 to mark Chinese and Tibetan strings up inside the text written in another language.

Chinese and Tibetan are defined according to Unicode ranges and Chinese in
fact means CJK. Support for strings in other Unicode ranges might be added
later.

The name is taken after Dunhuang Caves in China, containing important
manuscripts in both Chinese and Tibetan.

Dunhuang spells 燉煌 in Chinese and ཏུན་ཧོང་ in Tibetan. The Tibetan reading
was chosen as the name for the parser.

To illustrate the idea, the result of parsing the first sentence of the
previous paragraph with `TagMarkup` could be:

```Dunhuang spells <span lang="zh">燉煌</span> in Chinese and <span lang="bo">
ཏུན་ཧོང་</span> in Tibetan.```

or it could be:

```Dunhuang spells [c]燉煌[ↄ] in Chinese and [t]ཏུན་ཧོང་[ʇ] in Tibetan.```

depending on the user preference.

Modular design allows writing markups easily to perform different tasks.

All documentation can be found inside the code.

Requirements:

* Ruby 2.0 (works with 1.9 too)
* minitest for running tests

All bugs can be reported and issues can be discussed at the [official GitHub repository](https://github.com/infusiastic/tunhong).
